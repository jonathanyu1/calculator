This project aims to build a functional simple calculator using knowledge gained from the previous 'etch-a-sketch' project and subsequent learning on fundamentals of javscript arrays and objects.

What I learned:

- how to properly plan out a project before beginning any coding

- how to deal with tricky logic and refactor code to make it work properly

- re-using what I've learned from previous projects to assist me in this current one (ie. how to create grids to do what I want)
